# Security Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We release updates to the latest major version and may backport critical security patches to prior versions.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| x.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| <x.x.x  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately by emailing us at [security@asyrafnorafandi.dev](mailto:security@asyrafnorafandi.dev). Please do **not** open an issue publicly on the repository as this might compromise the security.

We will respond as soon as possible and work with you to resolve the issue.

## Security Updates

When security vulnerabilities are patched, we will:

1. Announce the fix in the repositoryâ€™s release notes.
2. Increment the version number and tag the release.
3. Notify the community via [communication channels, e.g., email, social media].

We encourage all users to update to the latest version whenever a security patch is released.

## Scope

We are committed to addressing vulnerabilities in:

- The core codebase of the project.
- Dependencies and third-party libraries used within the project.

However, vulnerabilities that arise from misconfiguration or improper usage outside of our control (e.g., deploying the application with insecure settings) are not covered under this policy.

## Contact

If you have any security-related questions or need further clarification, please contact us at [security@asyrafnorafandi.dev](malto:security@asyrafnorafandi.dev).

Thanks for helping keep the project secure!
